# HomeLab build on 1 small factor server running Debian 12

## Description 

In this project, we will explore the ways of building a HomeLab with minimal Hardware requirements. In this case, I am using an intel NUC i3 with 4 core, 8 threds running at 2.1GHz, with 8GB Ram and only 120 GB storage ! Small factor PC's of this kind can be cheap yet powerful enough to gain full sovereignty over your LAB ;)
